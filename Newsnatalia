Fire consumes candy store
The factory of the well-known candy *the happy sweet* suffered a fire that burned it almost
completely.
The fire started at 8:00 am last Thursday, when a group of workers noticed the start of the fire in
one of the machines at the premises.
Specialized firefighters went to the factory in a few minutes, but the flames of the fire had reached
the packaging area, where there were cardboard boxes that were devoured by the fire and served
to form very large flames that rose for more than seven meters. Tall.
Luckily, the workers were able to be evacuated in a timely manner and did not suffer any injuries,
except for two of them who were hospitalized due to lack of air.
At 5:00 pm the fire was brought under control, but the premises were almost completely
destroyed.
